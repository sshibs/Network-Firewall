Note that although this is called a 'blacklist', the categories can
be used as white or grey lists also.  Being listed does not infer that
the site is 'bad' - these are just lists of sites.

Disclaimer: URLBlacklist.com does not provide a categorised list that is completely inclusive of all web sites in existence - that would be impossible.  We provide no warranty or guarantee of the service.  We can not be held responsible for the sites or URLS listed in the blacklist.  The blacklist does contain sites which are wrongly categorised which is due to the bulk of the entries being collected using automatic scripts.  However we will do our best to improve the 'remove' list via submissions so the incorrect categorization will be minimised and the most common problem sites are unlikely to have a problem.
